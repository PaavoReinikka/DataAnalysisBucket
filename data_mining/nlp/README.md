## Some small NLP task using traditional/shallow methods

A small NLP project. It's using a small (and pretty selected) dataset, crawled from Arxiv, cleaned, and saved as csv's. The notebook is showing some ways to analyze the data (it has semantic indexing and some standard clustering approaches).

* Experiments notebook has some possible ways to analyze the data (very little commentary -- these were in a separate document).
* Functions.py has some utilities.

The csv file here on public git is just a small subset of the original data -- the original data is not mine, and it might still be in use elsewhere, so I don't want to include it here.
