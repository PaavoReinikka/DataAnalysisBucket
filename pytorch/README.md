## Here are a couple of work samples.

* DataAnalysis has something from my previous work, and some minor old research -- mostly just some prototyping style stuff, since I don't really have access to most of my old work code.

* pytorch has a couple of examples using torch (I think I did these just for demo purposes for my work --
most of my team had a more traditional/old-school statistics training, and very little knowledge of deep learning).
